**Project Overview**
This repository contains the design files and documentation for the power subsystem of the EEE3088F 2025 Micro-mouse project. The power module is responsible for providing regulated power to all components of the maze-solving robot while adhering to strict budget constraints.

**Key Features**
Dual-voltage power supply (3.3V @ 300mA and 5V @ 1.5A)

Battery charging system with two charging modes (200mA and 600mA)

USB-C power input with 9V output capability

Motor control for 4 DC motors (2x 200mA, 2x 500mA)

I2C-based battery monitoring via INA219

Low-power switch (<30Î¼A in OFF state)
